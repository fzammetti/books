A repository of the source code from all of my published tech books

I currently have a number of tech books published through Apress.  You can see them all here: http://www.apress.com/us/search?query=zammetti

While the source code for each of them was added to GitHub by Apress in their repo (https://github.com/Apress), and that is the "canonical" source for these, I wanted to have a copy of them in my own repository too, so here they are!  Each book has its own directory.

See the LICENSE file for full license details, but pretty much it boils down to the code is free to all and you can do pretty much anything you want with it as long as you aren't making money with it or claiming it as your own.

* **learn-corona-sdk-game-dev** -Corona SDK is one of the most popular app and game mobile development platforms in the world, and Learn Corona SDK Game Development walks you through creating a full-featured Corona game from scratch to the App Store. You'll learn Lua basics (the foundation of Corona), how to add and manipulate graphics, and how to use controls like multitouch, accelerometer, and gyroscope. You'll also learn how to use Box2D (Corona physics under the hood), and how to add sound effects and music. As you're polishing your game, you'll also learn about ads, in-app purchases, and OpenFeint and Game Center integration. Finally, you'll learn the ins and outs of getting a game into the App Store or other app marketplaces. (Published May 2013)

* **modern-full-stack-development** - Explore what React, Node, TypeScript, Webpack, and Docker have to offer individually, and how they all fit together in modern app development. React is one of the most popular web development tools available today, and Node.js is extremely popular for server-side development. The fact that both utilize JavaScript is a big selling point, but as developers use the language more, they begin to recognize the shortcomings, and that's where TypeScript comes in and why it's gaining in popularity quickly. Add Webpack and Docker to the mix, and you've got a potent full development stack on which to build applications. You'll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing two different real-world apps. These aren't just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. By the end, you will have a solid grasp of building apps with React, Node.js, and TypeScript and a good grasp on how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You'll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own.

* **practical-palm-pre-webos-projects** - In this book, you'll learn all about the Palm Pre and webOS, their capabilities, and how to develop for them. You'll learn to write applications that function entirely on the Pre itself, and you'll also learn to write applications that "live in the cloud" (i.e., keep you connected to the digital world around you). You'll spend most of your time looking at Mojo, the framework API through which your code interfaces with the operating system. All of this will be presented within the context of six fully functional real-world applications that you can use on your own Pre! (Published December 2009)

* **practical-jamstack** - Learn what JAMstack is all about, what those three big letters in the front mean and why it’s so beneficial.  This book shows you how to create sites and apps on the JAMstack using GatsbyJS, a tool made specifically for generating them.  As part of that, you’ll learn about React, one of the hottest front-end development tools out there today.  You will build three separate projects, starting with a relatively simple site to get your feet wet, then a more robust and dynamic application to see more advanced topics like API usage and data storage.  Finally, you’ll build a game on the JAMstack to get a whole different perspective on how all the pieces can fit together.  JAMstack, a modern take on best practices, is taking the web development world by storm and allowing developers to create web site and apps that are blazingly fast and highly secure. In many ways JAMstack is a throwback to web development of yesteryear, all while providing a simpler development experience that is streamlined by many years of best practices being brought to bear.
