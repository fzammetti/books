The main PhotoShare window should have now appeared.  If it has not, please
ensure that you have scripting enabled in your browser, and that you do not
have a popup blocker that has blocked the window from opening.  You may need
to create an exception for PhotoShare, or disable any popup blocker entirely.
<br><br>
Please note that PhotoShare is designed for a screen resolution of 1024x768.
It will of course work at lower resolutions, but your experience will not
be optimal.
